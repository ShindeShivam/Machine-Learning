# Machine Learning

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** Repository
This repo is a collection of everything I’ve learned and implemented while exploring **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**.

I’ve structured the repo into three major parts:

***1. Fundamentals of ML*** – Core algorithms & foundations.

***2. Deep Learning with TensorFlow*** – Neural networks & advanced DL with TensorFlow/Keras.

***3. Deep Learning with PyTorch*** – PyTorch implementations & projects.
